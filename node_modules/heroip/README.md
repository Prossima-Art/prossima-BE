## Usage / Example

**heroip** simplifies the process of IP address detection and geolocation in your Express.js applications. 

```javascript
import express from "express";
import heroip, { lookup } from "heroip";

const app = express(); // Create an Express app

app.use(heroip); // Use heroip middleware for IP info

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  const { ipInfo } = req; // Access IP information from the request object
  res.json(ipInfo); // Respond with IP details as JSON
});

const port = process.env.PORT || 3000; // Set the server port
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`); // Start the server
});

const ipAddress = "8.8.8.8"; // IP address to look up
const ipDetails = lookup(ipAddress); // Use lookup function to get IP details

console.log(ipDetails); // Log the IP details


```
## Why Use heroip?

The `heroip` package offers several compelling reasons to simplify IP address lookup and geolocation in your Node.js applications:
